\section{Variants of \UnrolledThree{}}
\label{app:variants_unrolled3}

We include an additional algorithm
\UnrolledThreeV{} (Listing~\ref{list:newton-unrolled-3v2}),
which is a modified version of the \UnrolledThree{} algorithm.

The results for the same analyses (standard and extended) between
\UnrolledThree{} and \UnrolledThreeV{} are included
in Tables~\ref{table:gas_costs_unrolled3},
\ref{table:minimal_gas_costs_unrolled3},
\ref{table:minimal_gas_costs_ed_unrolled3}, and
\ref{table:minimal_gas_costs_er_unrolled3}.
As we can see, there is no clear-cut winner.
\UnrolledThreeV{} has a lower maximum gas cost while
\UnrolledThree{} has lower mean and median gas cost.
Furthermore, although \UnrolledThree{} has minimal gas cost
in the majority of instances (between 55\% and 57\% of the time),
this is not a large margin.
It is unclear to the author why exactly this is the case.
He chose to use \UnrolledThree{} as the recommended algorithm
over \UnrolledThreeV{} because of the lower average gas cost
and majority of minimal gas cost.
