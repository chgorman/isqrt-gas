\section{Ethereum and the Ethereum Virtual Machine}

Ethereum is a blockchain designed to have the ability
to perform arbitrary computations~\cite{EthereumYellowpaper}.
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) executes all transactions on Ethereum.
While Turing-complete,
all operations cost a certain amount of \emph{gas}
and there is a limit to the amount of gas included within each block.
Thus, the efficiency of all operations on Ethereum
are measured by their gas usage.

The fundamental type is a \texttt{uint256} object:
a 256-bit unsigned integer.
Table~\ref{table:evm_gas} lists the costs of various
integer and bit operations within the EVM.
The fact that basic integer and bit operations are around 5 gas
while every transaction has a base cost of $21\cdot10^{3}$ gas
means that integer and bit operations are inexpensive.
The fact that clean (dirty) writes costs $20\cdot10^{3}$ ($5\cdot10^{3}$) gas
means that storing data on Ethereum is significantly more expensive;
thus, it is beneficial to minimize storage.
Another notable feature is that multiplication and division
have the same cost;
this fact is nontrivial,
and we note the following from a paper on computing integer square roots:
``The absence of division primitives is the main reason why we look
for an approximation of the inverse square root rather than the
square root itself''~\cite[Section 2]{FormalVerIsqrt}.
