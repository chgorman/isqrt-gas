\section{Integer Square Root Algorithm Overview}

\subsection{Definition}

Given $a\in\N$, the \emph{integer square root} of $a$
is the unique integer $m$ such that

\begin{equation}
    m^{2} \le a < \parens{m+1}^{2}.
\end{equation}

\noindent
This will be denoted as

\begin{equation}
    \isqrt{a} \mathDef{} m
\end{equation}

\noindent
and is equivalent to 

\begin{equation}
    \isqrt{a} = \floor{\sqrt{a}},
\end{equation}

\noindent
the integer part of the square root of $a$.

\subsection{Computation Methods}

One method for computing integer square roots is based
on Newton's method;
see~\cite[Algorithm 1.7.1]{cohen1993},
\cite[Algorithm 9.2.11]{PrimeNumbersACP2005},
and  \cite[Algorithm 1.13]{ModernComputerArithmetic051}.
Another method based on approximate square roots
may be found in \cite{PythonIsqrt}.
These algorithms usually come with a proof of correctness.
For completeness, we reproduce~\cite[Algorithm 1.7.1]{cohen1993}
in Algorithm~\ref{alg:cohen_isqrt},
and include a modified version of the
proof~\cite[Algorithm 1.7.1, Proof]{cohen1993}
in Appendix~\ref{proof:general_newton}.

The focus of this work is on computation within the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
There is no native integer square root function,
so this must be computed using only basic integer operations.
It is important for this fundamental operation to be efficient
\emph{and provably correct}.
We look at various algorithms found online
and compare them to see which is most efficient.
Additional algorithms have been included in the analysis
which are \emph{provably correct};
none of the algorithms found online have a correctness proof.
