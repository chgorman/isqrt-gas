\section{Integer Square Root Algorithm Overview}

\subsection{Definition}

Given $a\in\N$, the \emph{integer square root} of $a$
is the unique integer $m$ such that

\begin{equation}
    m^{2} \le a < \parens{m+1}^{2}.
\end{equation}

\noindent
This will be denoted as

\begin{equation}
    \isqrt{a} \mathDef{} m
\end{equation}

\noindent
and is equivalent to 

\begin{equation}
    \isqrt{a} = \floor{\sqrt{a}},
\end{equation}

\noindent
the integer part of the square root of $a$.

\subsection{Computation Methods}

Most methods for computing integer square roots are based
on Newton's method for computing square roots;
see~\cite[Algorithm 1.7.1]{cohen1993},
\cite[Algorithm 9.2.11]{PrimeNumbersACP2005},
and  \cite[Algorithm 1.13]{ModernComputerArithmetic051}.
Another method based on approximate square roots
may be found in \cite{PythonIsqrt}.
These algorithms usually come with a proof of correctness.

The focus on this work is on computation within the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
There is no native integer square root operation,
so this operation must be performed using only basic integer operations.
Given that this is a fundamental operation,
it is important for this operation to be as efficient as possible
\emph{and provably correct}.
The focus on this work is to look at various algorithms found online
and compare them to see which is most efficient.
Additional algorithms have been included which are \emph{provably correct};
none of the referenced algorithms found online have a correctness proof.
