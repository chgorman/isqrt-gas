\section{Extended Analysis}
\label{app:extended}

While the results in Section~\ref{sec:comparison} are good,
it is desirable to have a more extensive analysis.
The only algorithms tested are
\UnrolledThree{} (Listing~\ref{list:newton-unrolled-3}),
\WhileOne{} (Listing~\ref{list:newton-while-1}),
\WhileTwo{} (Listing~\ref{list:newton-while-2}), and
\WhileThree{} (Listing~\ref{list:newton-while-3}),
as these performed the best:
they had a significant number of values which were minimal.

The deterministic and random values will be separated.
All values tested in Section~\ref{sec:comparison}
are included in these tests.

\subsection{Deterministic Tests}
\label{app:deterministic}

We test additional deterministic values.
First, we include all deterministic values from Section~\ref{sec:comparison}.
Additional values are of the form $2^{k} + 2^{j}$ for $j,k\in\N$ and $j < k$.
The total number of values were 33154.
The results are shown in Table~\ref{table:minimal_gas_costs_ed}
and Figure~\ref{fig:minimal_gas_hist_ed}.

The minimal values have a different trend than before:
\UnrolledThree{} and \WhileOne{} both perform well.
The fact that \WhileOne{} performs the well in
Table~\ref{table:minimal_gas_costs_ed}
could be explained by noting that the initialization value in this test
frequently starts \emph{very close} to the correct value;
see the discussion on gas costs of \texttt{while} loops
in Appendix~\ref{app_gas_costs:while}.
It is interesting that \UnrolledThree{} performed
as well as it did in this situation which favors \WhileOne{}.

These results show it is easy to (unwittingly)
test values which are biased toward one particular algorithm.
This is the reason for testing a large collection
of random values in Appendix~\ref{app:loguniform}.

\subsection{Loguniform Tests}
\label{app:loguniform}

The tests in Section~\ref{sec:comparison} ran 1280 values
which came from a loguniform distribution~\cite{ScipyLoguniform}.
Here, we perform the same test using more samples;
in particular, we use $16384 = 2^{14}$ random values from 16808 samples.
The results are shown in Table~\ref{table:minimal_gas_costs_er}
and Figure~\ref{fig:minimal_gas_hist_er}.
In this case, \UnrolledThree{} performs well.

There is no significant difference between the results in 
Tables~\ref{table:minimal_gas_costs} and \ref{table:minimal_gas_costs_er}
or Figures~\ref{fig:minimal_gas_hist} and \ref{fig:minimal_gas_hist_er}.
\UnrolledThree{} has a majority of the minimal cost for random values.

\subsection{Conclusion}

This extended analysis gives additional insight but the same result:
\UnrolledThree{} is the best algorithm
for a generic \texttt{uint256} value.
