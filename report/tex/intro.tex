\section{Introduction}

Basic integer arithmetic and bit operations are included
within the Ethereum blockchain~\cite{EthereumYellowpaper};
all other functions must be derived from those simple operations.
We will look at various algorithms for computing integer square roots
on the Ethereum blockchain
(using the Solidity programming language~\cite{SolidityLanguage})
and compare their efficiency.
This work extends~\cite{EfficientIsqrt}
by adding candidate algorithms and improving the analysis.
The emphasis is on \emph{provably correct} algorithms which are efficient.
A version of these results may be found online~\cite{IsqrtRepo}.
