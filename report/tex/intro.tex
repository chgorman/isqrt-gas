\section{Introduction}

We will look at various algorithms for computing integer square roots
in Solidity and compare their efficiency (gas cost).
This work extends~\cite{EfficientIsqrt}
by adding more candidate algorithms and improving the analysis.
Although the emphasis will be on efficiency and implementation details,
we will also note when algorithms are \emph{provably correct},
which is important for such a fundamental operation.
A version of these results may be found online~\cite{IsqrtRepo}.
