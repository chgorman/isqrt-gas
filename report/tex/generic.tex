\section{Generic Algorithm Based on Newton's Method}

One method for computing integer square roots is based
on Newton's method;
see~\cite[Algorithm 1.7.1]{cohen1993},
\cite[Algorithm 9.2.11]{PrimeNumbersACP2005},
and \cite[Algorithm 1.13]{ModernComputerArithmetic051}.
While not the only method for computing integer square roots,
the efficiency of Newton's method causes us to focus on these algorithms;
additional algorithms are discussed in
Appendix~\ref{app:algs_optimizations}.
These algorithms usually come with a proof of correctness.
For completeness, we reproduce~\cite[Algorithm~1.7.1]{cohen1993}
in Algorithm~\ref{alg:cohen_isqrt},
and include a modified version of the
proof~\cite[Algorithm~1.7.1, Proof]{cohen1993}
in Appendix~\ref{proof:general_newton}.
