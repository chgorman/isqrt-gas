\caption[Halley's Method Gas Costs]{Here we
    compare running Halley's method from
    Listing~\ref{list:halley-unrolled-3}
    with \UnrolledThree{} (Listing~\ref{list:newton-unrolled-3});
    the value $3\cdot2^{160}$ was used.
    Even if it were possible to remove one Halley iteration,
    the total gas would only decrease from 952 to 817
    (which is still more expensive).
