\caption[Initialization Gas Costs]{Here we give
    the gas cost for initialization methods;
    note that we ignored the initial check and did not include
    return logic.
    \texttt{Newton1} is used by \UnrolledOne{} and \WhileOne{};
    \texttt{Newton2} is used by \UnrolledTwo{} and \WhileTwo{};
    \texttt{Newton3} is used by \WhileThree{};
    and \texttt{Newton3-Var} is used by \UnrolledThree{}.
    The value $2^{256}-1$ was used.
    This clearly shows that some of the more complex initialization methods
    cost more gas.
